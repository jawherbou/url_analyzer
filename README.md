to the form itself.

## Documentation

The documentation folder outlines the steps of my work and the 
logic put to get to the result. 
- I started first with a research (`research.md`) to search for 
possible tools and libraries that could help me
- With the outcome of the research I built a poc to validate my 
thoughts which led me to find another useful tool.
- Then I added a concept (`concept.md`) that drew a path for me
for thr rest of the project
- After having applied to all the functional requirements, I worked
on some improvements (`improvements.md`)
